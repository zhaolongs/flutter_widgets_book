description: MaterialApp组件的精通使用分析

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
#/Users/androidlongs/Desktop/flutter_book/code/flutter_book_code_1/flutter_book_code/pubspec.yaml
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
